                        <p><strong>You should consult a dermatologist or healthcare provider immediately if:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="warning-list">
                            <li>You notice any new, changing, or unusual moles or skin lesions</li>

                            <li>You have a family history of skin cancer</li>
                            <li>You have had significant sun exposure or sunburns</li>
                            <li>A mole shows asymmetry, irregular borders, color variation, or diameter greater than 6mm (ABCDE rule)</li>
                            <li>You have any concerns about your skin health</li>

                        <h2>Limitations of the AI Model</h2>
                        <p>While our deep learning model has been trained on thousands of images, it has important limitations:</p>
                        <ul class="limitations-list">
                            <li><strong>Not 100% Accurate:</strong> Even with high accuracy rates, the model can produce false positives and false negatives</li>
                            <li><strong>Image Quality Dependent:</strong> Poor lighting, blurry images, or incorrect angles can significantly affect results</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited Training Data:</strong> The model is trained on specific datasets that may not represent all skin types, lesion presentations, or rare conditions</li>
                            <li><strong>No Context Awareness:</strong> The AI cannot consider your medical history, symptoms, family history, or other clinical factors</li>
                            <li><strong>Skin Type Bias:</strong> Performance may vary across different skin tones and ethnicities due to dataset limitations</li>
                            <li><strong>Rare Conditions:</strong> The model may not accurately identify rare or unusual skin conditions not well-represented in training data</li>
                            <li><strong>Non-Cancerous Mimics:</strong> Benign conditions can sometimes resemble malignant lesions, and vice versa</li>
